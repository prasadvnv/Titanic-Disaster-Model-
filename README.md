# Titanic Disaster Model
This project predicts the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the Titanic based on factors such as age, class, gender, and more. The model leverages machine learning algorithms for classification and is implemented using Python. The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

## Installation Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab)
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
 ## Files
- titanic_model.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook containing the model development and analysis.
- train.csv: Dataset containing the details of Titanic passengers for training the model.
- test.csv: Dataset containing passenger details for making predictions.

## Usage
1. Open the titanic_model.ipynb notebook in Jupyter.
2. Load the datasets and preprocess the data.
3. Train a machine learning model using classification algorithms.
4. Evaluate the model and visualize results.
